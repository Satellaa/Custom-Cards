# Custom Cards for EDOPro
## How to install custom cards?
This method works for both PC and Mobile EDOPro, but on mobile the ***ProjectIgnis*** folder can be named ***EDOPRO***.

1. Click [here][df2] to download the file [user_config.json][df2]
2. Once the download is done, move it to the ***ProjectIgnis/configs*** folder
3. Open or restart EDOPro and wait for the files to be downloaded

As long as you have `user_config.json` on your ***device***, the game will always update itself, so you don't have to download it again and again every time custom cards are updated

## How to use custom cards in the Deck?
All custom cards here are formatted with ***custom card EDOPro*** and therefore do not appear by default in your card catalog, to use them, you must enable the ***alternative formats*** option available in Deck editing.

## How do I play with custom cards or against bots with friends on LAN?
You have a couple of options:
1. Port forward the LAN ports used by EDOPro and give your friend your IP to join in LAN mode.
2. You and your friends can set up a VPN like [ZeroTier][df3] so everybody is on the same virtual LAN. Then you should be able to refresh the LAN room list or connect to the IP provided by the VPN. Both players must have the custom card databases to see what the cards are, and the hosting player must have the card scripts.

Keep in mind that all custom cards are in "custom" format, so you need to set "Allowed Cards" to "Anything goes"

## BUGS
If you find any BUG in the effects of the cards, please use the ***ISSUE*** tab to report, the same goes for errors in  PSCT, errors in card interactions, etc.  Preferably this is done in as much detail as possible.
