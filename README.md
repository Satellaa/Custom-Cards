# Lilac - Custom Card
## How to install custom cards?
This method works for both PC and Mobile EDOPro, but on mobile the ***ProjectIgnis*** folder can be named ***EDOPRO***.

1. Click [here][df2] to download the file [user_config.json][df2]
2. Once the download is done, move it to the ***ProjectIgnis/configs*** folder
3. Open EDOPro and wait for the files to be downloaded

As long as you have `user_config.json` on your computer, the game will always update itself, so you don't have to download it again and again every time custom cards are updated

## How to use custom cards in the Deck?
All custom cards here are formatted with ***custom card EDOPro*** and therefore do not appear by default in your card catalog, to use them, you must enable the ***alternative formats*** option available in Deck editing.

## How to use custom cards in a duel?
Custom cards can be used in the game in ***LAN + AI*** mode and in ***online*** mode, on any EDOPro server, however, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

 1. Both players need to have custom cards in their game

2. When creating a duel server, some changes need to be made in the duel settings, namely changing the Allowed Cards  option to Anything Goes

3. If the game still prevents you from creating the game, check the option ***Don't check Deck Contents*** is active or not
4. Custom cards can be used with ***anybanlist***, EDOPro need not worry about them being banned as they are unofficial

## BUGS
If you find any BUG in the effects of the cards, please use the ***ISSUE*** tab to report, the same goes for errors in  PSCT, errors in card interactions, etc.  Preferably this is done in as much detail as possible.
